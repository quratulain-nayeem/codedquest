            <h1>Programming Languages Information</h1>
            <div class="info-text">
                <p>Programming languages are tools that allow us to communicate with computers and create software applications. Each language has its unique features and is suited for different types of tasks. Here are a few commonly used programming languages and their purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python:</strong>
                        <p>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and the use of significant indentation. Python is used in a wide variety of fields and applications due to its versatility and ease of use. It is commonly used for web development, AI/ML, data science, analytics, software development, and many more. Python is used widely due to several key advantages it offers, making it a popular choice among developers and organizations. Some of the reasons why it is used are:</p>
                        <ul class="sub-list">
                            <li>Readability and simplicity</li>
                            <li>Versatility</li>
                            <li>Interpreted language</li>
                            <li>Integration capabilities</li>
                            <li>Rapid development and prototyping</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These features combine to make Python a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly language that meets the needs of a wide range of programming tasks, from simple scripting to complex machine learning applications.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong>
                        <p>Essential for web development, JavaScript allows developers to create interactive elements on websites. It runs in web browsers and is a key technology alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Java:</strong>
                        <p>A versatile language used in many large-scale enterprise applications, mobile apps (especially Android), and web services. Java is known for its portability across platforms.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>C++:</strong>
                        <p>An extension of the C language, C++ is used in system/software development, game development, and performance-critical applications. It offers fine control over system resources.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ruby:</strong>
                        <p>Known for its elegant syntax, Ruby is often used in web development with the Ruby on Rails framework. It emphasizes simplicity and productivity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Swift:</strong>
                        <p>Developed by Apple, Swift is used for building iOS and macOS applications. It's designed to be safe, fast, and expressive.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong>
                        <p>Not a general-purpose language, SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and manipulating databases. It's essential for backend development and data analysis.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding these languages' purposes can help beginners choose the right one based on their interests and career goals. Each language has a community and plenty of resources to help new learners get started.</p>
